\section{Methods}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Participants}
Thirty subjects participated in this experiment (21 males; $age_{range}$ 18$-$26, $age_mean=22.2$; $age_SD=2.5$). All the participants gave informed consent.\\
Participants were primarily found amongst students from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Radboud University. Cognitive deficits\footnote{Also included unfamiliarity with the English language. This criterion was chosen to ensure comprehension of material and instructions.}, epilepsy\footnote{Rapid serial visual presentation uses fast presented stimuli, so this criteria was added as a precaution.}, and dyslexia\footnote{We used artificial words in the experiment and the participant should have no trouble distinguishing between letters and registering the order of letters.} were exclusion criteria
The experiment had a between subject design to asses the effect of different reading speeds and exposure time, using three groups:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{normal}: the task was performed using three times 20 words for training and the stimuli were presented at a normal reading rate of 150 words per minute.
	\item \textit{fast-amount}: the task was performed using three times 20 words for training and the stimuli were presented at a fast presentation rate of 450 words per minute.
	\item \textit{fast-time}: the task was performed using nine times 20 words for training and the stimuli were presented at a fast presentation rate of 450 words per minute.
\end{enumerate}
Ten participants were randomly assigned to each group (\textit{normal}: four males, $age_{range}$ 18$-$26 $age_mean=22$, $age_SD=2.4$; \textit{fast-amount}: nine males, $age_{range}$ 19$-$26, $age_mean=22.5$; $age_SD=2.5$; \textit{fast-time}: eight males, $age_{range}$ 19$-$26, $age_mean=22.1$, $age_SD=2.6$).\\

\subsection{Procedure}
Upon arrival, participants were given pre-questionnaires asking for their age, gender, spoken languages, and speed reading experience.
The experiment consisted of three phases for all groups (shown in Figure \ref{fig:tasktimeline}). \\
In the practice phase, participants were asked to read an excerpt of Beauty and the Beast\footnote{\url{http://www.storynory.com/2008/04/28/beauty-and-the-beast-2/}} to become acquainted with RSVP. After every couple of sentences the presentation rate would be increased by 50 wpm. The initial speed was 150 wpm, the final was 450 wpm. Participants were always informed when their reading rate increased and were asked to continue with a button press.
The training phase differed between groups, as explained above. Here, participants were exposed to three or nine repetitions (blocks) of the same 20 exemplars of the artificial grammar shown in the first column of Table \ref{tab:stimuli}. All participants were told that these exemplars would be presented at one of the rates used in the practice session. After each block, participants were given the opportunity to take a self-timed break.

\caption{An artificial grammar is given by a finite state machine. States are indicated by circles labeled $S_{i}$. $S_{0}$ is the initial state. Every grammatical item has to start with a transition via an arrow from the initial state to a state directly connected to it (in this case $S_{1}$ or $S_{2}$). States encircled by two lines are final states ($S_{3}$, $S_{4}$, $S_{5}$). The machine can be exited from any final state. The arrows indicate legal transition directions (in this example, it is legal to move from $S_{3}$ to $S_{2}$ but not the other way around). Words are formed by concatenating the letters assigned to each arrow in the order of making the transition (grammatical words are for example MVS, VXRRR).}

\end{figure}
In the test phase, participants were informed that the words they had just been exposed to followed certain underlying rules. They were further instructed to follow their `gut feeling' during the test session. Participants were then presented with 100 words, 25 of which were grammatical and 25 were ungrammatical (shown in the second and third column of Table \ref{tab:stimuli}). These 50 unique items were all repeated once to obtain a measure for consistency. All responses were recorded for the analysis.\\
To gain insights into participants decision making strategies, a final questionnaire assessed how participants chose whether a word was ruleful or unruleful.

The practice session starts at 150 words per minute and after each 3-4 sentences the participant is notified and the speed increases with steps of 50. After practice, instructions for the training session are given and the training starts after a countdown of 3 seconds. During the test session, no feedback is given to ensure that the participants are not learning grammar rules from the test session, only after all questions are answered the correct response rate is given. This concludes the task.}

\subsection{Materials}
The experiment was conducted in a soundproof room with a desktop computer. A program to execute the test as explained earlier was developed in Python 2.7.8 using the PsychoPy stiumulus generation library \citep{peirce2008generating}. The stimuli are based on the grammar as seen in Figure \ref{fig:grammar} and can be found in Table \ref{tab:stimuli}.

\subsection{Analysis}
The total number of correct classifications on the 100 test items, $P_{C}$, was determined for each participant. To compare observed to chance level performance for each condition, the one-sample \textit{t}-test (or Wilcoxon signed rank test\footnote{The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to check whether it could be assumed that the samples were drawn from a normally distributed population for each condition. We choose this test because it has the greatest statistical power for small sample sizes \citep{yazici2007comparison}}) will be employed. This will be performed one-tailed because only above chance level performance is of interest.
Due to the repetition of each test item, participants could classify each unique item in one of four ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Correct-Correct (CC): classified correctly on both presentations
\item Correct-Erroneous (CE): classified correctly on the first presentation but incorrectly on the second
\item Erroneous-Correct (EC): classified incorrectly on the first presentation but correctly on the second
\item Erroneous-Erroneous (EE): misclassified on both presentations
\end{enumerate}
The sum of CC and EE denotes overall consistency. `When the status of the item is known, it is always classified correctly; when it is not known, a guess is made.' \citep[p.~227]{reber1989implicit}. Using this simple model as a basis, \citeauthor{reber1989implicit} states that CE, EC, and EE should not be statistically distinguishable from each other, since they all reflect guesses. On the other hand, if EE is significantly greater than the average of CE and EC, it can be inferred that judgments were based on rules that are not representative of the grammar. Furthermore, CC should be significantly higher than each of the other three variables if the participants actually implicitly learned a correct, albeit partial, representation of the grammar. Finally, if the difference between CE and EC or EC and CE is significant, it is indicative of forgetting or learning during the testing phase respectively (for an in-depth discussion see \citet{reber1989implicit}). All these measures will be compared to each other using a paired-samples \textit{t}-test. 
Finally, we are interested in seeing whether performance across groups is correlated with the number of languages participants speak or their speed reading experience. To explore this, we will determine Pearson's correlation coefficient for both of these variables.
